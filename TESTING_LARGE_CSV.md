# Testing Large CSV Performance

## Quick Start Guide

### Testing with Your 320k+ Row CSV File

1. **Build and Run the Application**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/thuan.nv/workspaces/myself_rephraser
   flutter run -d macos
   ```

2. **Open CSV Reader**
   - Click on "CSV File Reader" button in the main screen
   - Or navigate to Tools ‚Üí CSV File Reader

3. **Load Your Large CSV File**
   - Click "Open CSV File" or drag & drop your CSV file
   - Watch the progress bar - it will show:
     - Percentage loaded (0% - 100%)
     - Number of rows loaded in real-time
   - For 320k rows, expect ~30 seconds load time

4. **Verify Optimized Mode**
   - Once loaded, look for the green "OPTIMIZED MODE" badge in the title bar
   - This confirms the optimized engine is active

### Performance Testing Checklist

#### ‚úÖ Loading Performance
- [ ] File loads with visible progress bar
- [ ] UI remains responsive during loading
- [ ] Progress updates smoothly (no freezing)
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 100MB (check Activity Monitor)

#### ‚úÖ Scrolling Performance
- [ ] Scroll to top of file - should be instant
- [ ] Scroll to middle (row ~160k) - should be smooth
- [ ] Scroll to bottom (row 320k) - should be instant
- [ ] Use scroll bar to jump to random positions - no lag
- [ ] FPS should stay at 60 (use Flutter DevTools)

#### ‚úÖ Data Operations
- [ ] Double-click a cell to edit - opens dialog instantly
- [ ] Edit cell value and save - updates immediately
- [ ] Select multiple cells with Cmd+Click - no delay
- [ ] Search for a term - results appear quickly
- [ ] Toggle compact mode - instant refresh

#### ‚úÖ Memory Efficiency
- [ ] Initial load memory spike < 200MB
- [ ] Stable memory usage after load (~40-60MB)
- [ ] Scrolling doesn't increase memory significantly
- [ ] Memory stays constant even after 5+ minutes of use

### Performance Benchmarks (Expected)

| Operation | Expected Time | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Load 320k rows | 25-40s | Progress visible, no freeze |
| Scroll to row 1 | <100ms | Instant |
| Scroll to row 320k | <100ms | Instant |
| Jump to middle | <200ms | Smooth transition |
| Edit single cell | <500ms | Dialog opens immediately |
| Search 320k rows | <2s | Results visible |
| Save file | 30-60s | Progress visible |

### Comparison Test

To see the improvement, you can compare with the old implementation:

1. **Old Implementation** (for files <100k rows only):
   - Edit `lib/screens/main_screen.dart`
   - Change import to `csv_reader_screen_modern.dart`
   - Try loading a 50k row file - notice the delay

2. **New Implementation** (current):
   - Handles 320k+ rows effortlessly
   - Same responsive behavior for any file size

### Generating Test CSV Files

If you need test files of specific sizes:

**Option 1: Online Generator**
- Visit: https://www.mockaroo.com/
- Set rows to 320,000
- Add 10-20 columns with various data types
- Download as CSV

**Option 2: Python Script**
```python
import csv
import random
import string

def generate_csv(filename, rows=320000, cols=10):
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        
        # Headers
        headers = [f'Column_{i+1}' for i in range(cols)]
        writer.writerow(headers)
        
        # Data
        for _ in range(rows):
            row = [
                ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=20))
                for _ in range(cols)
            ]
            writer.writerow(row)
    
    print(f"Generated {filename} with {rows} rows")

# Generate test file
generate_csv('test_320k.csv', 320000, 15)
```

**Option 3: Command Line (macOS/Linux)**
```bash
# Generate 320k row CSV with 10 columns
seq 1 320000 | awk '{printf "%d", $1; for(i=2;i<=10;i++) printf ",%d", int(rand()*1000); print ""}' > test_320k.csv
```

### Memory Monitoring

**Using Activity Monitor (macOS):**
1. Open Activity Monitor
2. Find "myself_rephraser" or "flutter" process
3. Watch "Memory" column during:
   - Initial load
   - Scrolling
   - Editing operations
4. Expected: 40-80MB stable, peaks to 150MB during load

**Using Flutter DevTools:**
```bash
# Open DevTools
flutter pub global activate devtools
flutter pub global run devtools

# Run app with DevTools
flutter run -d macos --observatory-port=9100
```
Then open browser to http://localhost:9100 and monitor:
- Memory timeline
- Widget rebuild count
- FPS during scrolling

### Known Limitations in Optimized Mode

The following features are **not yet implemented** in optimized mode:

- ‚ùå Column deletion (shows message)
- ‚ùå Row insertion (shows message)
- ‚ùå Undo/Redo (disabled)
- ‚ùå Merge rows (disabled)
- ‚ùå Split rows (disabled)
- ‚ùå Bulk operations (disabled)

These work fine in the old mode for smaller files (<100k rows).

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Loading CSV file..." stuck at 0%**
- Solution: Check file permissions, try different file
- Check: Terminal/console for error messages

**Problem: High memory usage (>500MB)**
- Solution: Close and reopen app
- Check: Are multiple CSV files open?

**Problem: Scrolling is laggy**
- Solution: Toggle compact mode, restart app
- Check: Is search filter active? Clear filters

**Problem: "OPTIMIZED MODE" badge not showing**
- Solution: File might be <100k rows (both modes work)
- Check: Status bar shows total row count

**Problem: Can't save changes**
- Solution: Make sure file is not read-only
- Check: File permissions in Finder

### Reporting Performance Issues

If you encounter performance issues, please provide:

1. **File Details**
   - Number of rows
   - Number of columns
   - File size in MB
   - Any special characters or encoding

2. **System Info**
   - macOS version
   - Available RAM
   - CPU model

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Load time
   - Memory usage (Activity Monitor)
   - Specific operation that's slow

4. **Screenshots**
   - Progress bar (if stuck)
   - Memory usage graph
   - Any error messages

### Success Criteria

Your implementation is working correctly if:

‚úÖ 320k row file loads in under 60 seconds  
‚úÖ Memory stays under 100MB after loading  
‚úÖ Scrolling is smooth (60 FPS) at any position  
‚úÖ Cell editing opens dialog in under 500ms  
‚úÖ Application remains responsive during all operations  
‚úÖ No crashes or freezes during normal use
