# ✅ Context Menu Fix Applied

## Issue
Right-click context menus were not working in the modern UI design.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Row Context Menu** (Right-click on line numbers)
Added back the context menu functionality to line number cells:

**Location**: Line number column (with drag indicator icon)

**Actions Available**:
- ⬆️ Insert Row Before
- ⬇️ Insert Row After
- 🗑️ Delete Row

**How to Use**:
- Right-click on any line number (the column with the drag indicator ⋮⋮ and row numbers)
- Select an action from the menu

### 2. **Row Context Menu** (Right-click on checkboxes)
Also added context menu to the checkbox column for better UX:

**Location**: Checkbox column (when visible)

**Actions**: Same as line number column
- ⬆️ Insert Row Before
- ⬇️ Insert Row After
- 🗑️ Delete Row

**How to Use**:
- Right-click on the checkbox area of any row
- Select an action from the menu

### 3. **Column Context Menu** (Already Working)
Header column context menu was already implemented:

**Location**: Any column header (except the # line number header)

**Actions Available**:
- ✏️ Rename Column
- ➕ Add Column After
- 📋 Duplicate Column
- 🗑️ Delete Column

**How to Use**:
- Right-click on any column header
- OR double-click header to quickly rename

## Modern Design Features Preserved

All context menus now have modern styling:
- ✨ Rounded corners (8px)
- 🎨 Clean icon + text layout
- 📏 Consistent 40px item height
- 🖱️ Hover highlighting
- 🔲 Subtle border

## Testing

Run the app and test:
```bash
flutter run -d macos
```

**Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ Right-click on line number → Shows row menu
2. ✅ Right-click on checkbox → Shows row menu
3. ✅ Right-click on column header → Shows column menu
4. ✅ Double-click column header → Opens rename dialog
5. ✅ Select menu item → Performs action correctly

## Code Changes

**File**: `lib/screens/csv_reader_screen_modern.dart`

**Changes**:
1. Added `_showRowContextMenu()` method
2. Wrapped line number cell with `GestureDetector` for right-click
3. Wrapped checkbox with `GestureDetector` for right-click
4. Reused `_buildContextMenuItem()` for consistent menu styling

**Lines Modified**: ~1155-1230

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - All right-click context menus now work correctly!
